This project aimed to develop a predictive model for house prices. By leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of the XGBoost Regressor algorithm. Feature selection and ordinal encoding were employed to enhance model performance. The model demonstrated promising results in predicting house prices, as evaluated by the Mean Absolute Error metric. Future directions may include exploring alternative algorithms, incorporating additional features, and delving into techniques like hyperparameter tuning to further optimize accuracy.
